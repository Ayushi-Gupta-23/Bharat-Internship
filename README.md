_**This repository has following projects:-**_
**1.Wine quality prediction** : _Here in this project, I have predicted the quality of wine on the basis of given features. I have used the wine quality dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. I have used Linear Regression to predict the quality of the wine._

**2. Iris classification** : _This is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, 'Sepal length', 'Sepal width', 'Petal length', 'Petal width'. Thesefeatures are used to classify the classes of flowers._
